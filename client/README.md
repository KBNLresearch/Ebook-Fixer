# Fixing E-Books Client Side

This is the main User Interface for the app.
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Getting started

To just run our app, follow the instructions in the main README file in the root of the project to launch it with docker.

This is a great solution for showing a demo, but for development you could choose a different workflow, such as this:

-   Have the backend & database running in docker
-   Have the front end running natively so that hot reloading is available (your changes can be seeen right after you save)

To achieve something like that, you have to install `npm` and run `npm install` in the `/client` directory to install all the packages required for the project. Then you can use `npm start` which is described below:

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run lint`

Runs [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) to lint and check the correctness of the code. Generates a report in console.

### `npm run lint:fix`

Runs [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) with the `--fix` parameter to automatically fix issues with the code that can be fixed automatically.

### `npm run format`

Runs [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to automatically reformat all the code in `./src` to the format specified in our `package.json`.

### `npm run docs`

Runs [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/index.html) generate pretty documentation in the `/docs/client` folder (from the root of the project).

## Recommended Development Environment

We recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as it's well suited to front-end development. Make sure you have the following plugins installed for the right styling and linting to be applied during development:

-   [Prettier on the VS Code marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
-   [ESLint on the VS Code marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
